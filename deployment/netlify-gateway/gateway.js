<h1>Privacy</h1>
<p>There is no privacy on the internet, and services which promise such are just one breach away from losing your data. Instead, we simply do not ask you for any information that is not already out there for a service like the one you're using. If it's a business card app, for instance, it's going to need a name and email just like what you'd have on a real business card. This card will be publicly available. If you don't want your name and email known, do not add them in the business card app. Stay suspicious of anyone who is not up front on how this works.</p>
